  algorithm: `
  Mimis is a global editor. She flies across the world to find quality news with a variety of perspectives. She is an attempt to solve the current crisis of journalism through curation.
  \nEvery day she checks +1,000 news sites and forums and +15,000 twitter profiles of public experts for recommended journalism.
  \nMimis draws her name from the birds in Norse mythology that gave Odin his information. Like a bird, she soars to the skies to get a proper perspective.
  \nShe then organises them according to topics, length, recency and popularity to give people access to relevant quality articles from the entire spectrum.

  team: `
  \nMimis reflects our care for quality journalism and our desire for it to thrive in this age of click-bait, fake news, filter bubbles, sensationalism, and low-attention-span 24/7 copy-cat news cycles.
  \nAs its Editorial Board, you can hold us accountable for Mimis' editorial choices and biases. We will respond to those feedbacks so that Mimis stays in tune with its readers.
  \nAnders represents the AI portion of Mimis. He does the coding and fine-tunes the algorithm according to feedback. 
  \nDaniel represents the human touch, by reading and vetting articles and selecting the editorial picks.
  \nIn contrast to traditional editors, we don't have a background in journalism. We think that's a good thing as that places us outside the media bubble. Instead we have a deep understanding of politics, finance, business and technology, the primary forces shaping today's society.

  vision: `
  Mimis is an attempt to provide quality news from every filter bubble. We actively strive to include as many sources as possible, doing our best to span the entire globe and the broadest possible range of viewpoints.
  \nThere is an inherent tension between quality and range as the quality is often a subjective matter. We will therefore sometimes err on the side of variety as we prefer a lively intellectual landscape over stale approved quality.
  \nHaving said that, we take comfort in the care with which the algorithm has been built, which has a natural tilt towards articles recommended by curators and experts.
